# Overwatch Settings Transfer

So you want to play on a new account, but on your main you've adjusted the sensitivity for each hero.

Do you want to spend hours transferring all those settings across manually? Of course not!

This script allows you to capture all your individual hero sensitivities as a JSON file. You can then run it again on your new account to load up the custom sensitivity for each hero.
